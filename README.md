# Arch Linux and Hyprland Configuration Files

Configuration files from my (desktop) Linux system, which I use for school and coding. Inspired by [this](https://github.com/luyu-wu/Config), among other configs.

## What I Use

-   [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty): a cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator.
-   [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst): lightweight and customizable notification daemon.
-   [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch): a maintained, feature-rich and performance oriented, neofetch like system information tool.
-   [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/): an independent, highly customizable, dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.
-   [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar): highly customizable Wayland bar for Sway and Wlroots based compositors.
-   many more tools not included in this repository.
